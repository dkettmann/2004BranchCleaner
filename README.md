Historical Archive of Perl scripts written in 2004 - BranchCleaner

I wrote these scripts in aprox 2003-2004 for a previous employer.

From what I remember, this program would read a downloaded config file in text format and run each line of the config through
a gauntlet of filters to pull unwanted config lines out. If the line of config made it through it was written to a "clean" config file.
